- The dir() function returns all properties and methods of the specified object, without the values.

- We can get an iterator from an iterable by calling iter() function.

- `print("format_string"string_modulo_operator(tuple_with_value))`
- indicator: `%[flags][width][.precision]type `
- `print("{arfument:indicator}"format(values))`

Arrays need to be declared whereas lists do not need declaration because they are a part of Python's syntax. This is the reason lists are more often used than arrays. But in case you want to perform some arithmetic function to your list, one should go with arrays instead.

A sequence is a succession of values bound together by a container that reflects their type. Almost every stream that you put in Python is a sequence.

Types of Sequences

- Lists
- Tuples
- Xrange
- String
