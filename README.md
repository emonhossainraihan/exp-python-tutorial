## PEP: Python Enhancement Proposal

[docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)

> Strongly Typed: Will not be automatically converted from one type to another. Weakly (loosely) Typed: Will be automatically converted to one type to another

The runtime of the language really defines whether or not its weakly typed otherwise its really just opinion.

- Static: Types checked before run-time
- Dynamic: Types checked on the fly, during execution

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purposeprogramming language. It is is dynamically typed andgarbage-collected.

## The Zen of Python

Perhaps the best known collection of Python philosophy was written by Tim Peters, long-time contributor to the language.

Explicit means done by the programmer. Implicit means done by the VM or the tool , not the Programmer.
