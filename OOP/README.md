Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic.

`code > Byte code > Compiler > machine code`

```py
# test.py
class Dog:
    def __init__(self):
        self.bark()
```

`python test.py` Code is runned in the runtime not compilation time.

Dunder or magic methods in Python are the methods having two prefix and suffix underscores in the method name.
